# go-interpreter

This repository is my implementation of the interpreter from the book Writing an Interpreter in Go by Thornsten Ball. I completed this project as self-study to become familiar with Go and learn how interpreted languages work under the hood. I highly recommend the book if you would like to demystify interpreted languages.

## Usage

Clone the repo and run the following command to use the REPL.
```
go run main.go
```
